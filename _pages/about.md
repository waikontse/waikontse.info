## About me
My name is Wai kon, 34 years old, born and raised on Aruba. Together with my family of 1 living in Schiedam. I'm a passionate, pragmatic, and driven software engineer who likes learning new things. Furthermore I would love to develope software that really adds value and enjoys working on algorithms. In my free time I like cycling on my road bike, BBQ when the weather permits it, reading books, and play boardgames.

## What I Do

I'm a Java developer with front-end experience, preferably working on the back-end. My passion is to design and build high-quality and appropriate architecture for a problem domain. I prefer to work in a small team on a project. This way red-tape is kept to a minimum and sharing/spreading of knowledge is much faster. Besides researching and implementing new architectures and techniques, I'm always ready to help and spar with colleagues.
On a team-level, I'm always on the lookout for improvements. How can I improve the team communication, or how the current development methodology can be improved upon. I've introduced scrum when it was just getting hip, or Phabricator because the workflow worked better for the team.
On code-level, I always try to tame the complexity. Writing tests, refactor, writing documentation all helps with taming the complexity of your code. Besides programming, I'm always busy improving and broadening my technical skills, by following courses on Pluralsight, going to conventions, and reading blogs. 
I'm love a challenge, preferably with techniques I'm unfamiliar with, this keeps me focused and critical.
